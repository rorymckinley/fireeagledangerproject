# Goal

# Guiding Concepts

* Project-based learning
* TDD, Pairing, Refactoring (XP)
* SCRUM (Working in software teams)
* Version Control
* Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
* Free Open Source Software (FOSS)
* Object Oriented Design

# Tools

* Linux
* Ruby, Ruby on Rails
* HTML/CSS/Javascript
* Git/GitHub/Heroku
* Android App Builder
* WXRuby
* LightBot
* Shoes.rb / Hackety Hack
* http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram
* Kids Ruby

# Structure

Sessions will be based on a series of fun, short projects (3-4 sessions each, depending on progress).
Guiding concepts will be explained and reinforced in each session.

# Projects

## LightBot & Ruby

* Learning programming thinking with Lightbot flash game
* Ruby: LearnToProgram tutorials.

## A Shoes.rb calculator

(Using Shoes Calculator)

## Hello Twitter

### Session 1

Pair programming.

Lightbot - 1/2 session

Twitter - what is it - show them the site - sign up
  - Show them the basic twitter app on server (add username, client name for
API - hashtag hardcoded)
  - Get them to make a post - watch the posts appear

Illustrate concepts :

  * Client/Server interaction - what is a client - browser  vs server -
client can be the server

### Session 2: --> Lightbot function levels

Lightbot subroutines & Ruby functions

Make the App read - reuse connectivity code - tie back to Lightbot and
subroutines

Bad refactor example - breaks code - chat about legacy code - how would
we prevent this? (Debugging to find the error) - Tie in to lightbot

Test coverage

### Session 3

Add new functionality - search on a tag --> put something in to make
mocking invisible

Introduce TDD

### Session 4

Intentionally break something. Need to rollback.

Introduce SCM/VCS with Git.
