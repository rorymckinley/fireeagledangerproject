# Collaborative Origami
By Michael McCullough, on June 20th, 2009

## Timing: 15 mins

## Ingredients:
* Origami instructions for half the participants [like this one](http://blog.tastycupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Origami-Instructions-Improving.pdf)
* Blank standard sized printer paper for half the participants

## Directions:

Pair up participants and provide an instruction sheet (face down) to one person in each pair (the “instructor”), and provide a blank sheet of paper to the other member of the pair (the “folder”). Split the pairs into three groups:
* Group 1 sits side-by-side,
* Group 2 sits face-to-face, and
* Group 3 sits back-to-back.

On “Go!” the person with the instruction sheet flips it over and instructs the other member of the pair how to fold the origami.
* In Group 1, one person folds, but both can consult the instruction sheet as much as needed.
* In Group 2, the folder must not see the instruction sheet, but the instructor can watch the folder and provide feedback on progress.
* In Group 3, the instructor and the folder cannot see each other, but they can talk (over their shoulders) as much as possible.

As each group successfully completes the origami item, have them stand up. The facilitator may cut it off after a period of time, because Group 3 may not successfully finish.

## Learning Points:
* Collaboration leads to faster results and better quality.
* Communication barriers on geographically dispersed teams can be disastrous, even if there is unlimited verbal communication.
* Visual maps are a useful communication tool.
